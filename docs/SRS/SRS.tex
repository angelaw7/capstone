\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Purpose of Document}

The purpose of this SRS document is to describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the Plutos budgeting application. This document serves as a formal agreement between stakeholders, including developers, project managers, and end users, to ensure a shared understanding of the system's objectives, capabilities, and constraints. \\

\noindent The SRS defines the expectations for the project, detailing the system features, behaviour, and performance requirements. It serves as a reference throughout the development lifecycle, guiding the design, implementation, testing, and validation phases to ensure the final product meets the agreed-upon specifications. Additionally, this document will support future maintenance and scalability of the application by providing clear and detailed requirements that facilitate ongoing enhancements.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

The scope of this project encompasses the development of a budgeting application, Plutos, that automates expense tracking 
and categorization using AI. The system is designed to address key pain points for young adults struggling to manage their 
finances, specifically focusing on automating the process of tracking spending through receipt scanning, categorization of 
expenses, providing metrics to users regarding their spending habits, and providing feedback on how users can meet their 
budgeting goals.\\

\noindent However, some features that are outside the scope of the project (though may be implemented later) are: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item The system will not account for complex financial scenarios such as investments, stock portfolios, or retirement planning.
  \item Advanced financial forecasting or predictive analytics beyond simple budgeting trends will not be implemented.
  \item The AI model will not handle non-standard or highly complex receipts (e.g., multi-page invoices or handwritten receipts).
  \item The application will not offer integration with external financial accounts such as credit cards or bank accounts.
  \item The model will be trained to detect receipt data from Fortinos and will not initially support various receipt formats.
\end{itemize}

\noindent These exclusions allow the project to concentrate on core features, such as receipt scanning and expense categorization, while ensuring a manageable scope for the development process.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}
The primary audience for this SRS document is the group of undergraduate
software engineering students who will oversee and complete the project’s design
and implementation. This group of specialists, which includes system architects,
software developers, and quality assurance testers, has extensive experience in
the range of technologies needed for the project. Through their coursework and
personal experiences, they are familiar with the process of developing mobile
applications, and as they move through the project milestones, they will deepen
their understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
They will actively learn how to apply AI/ML technologies in real-world
circumstances throughout the project, which will advance their development as
software engineers. The collaborative effort will help them improve their
real-world application development abilities as the project progresses through
seven milestones, ensuring that they are prepared to produce a practical and
user-friendly budgeting solution.
\subsection{Organization of Document}

The following sections of the SRS will further describe the system and its requirements. The sections will be as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{2}

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.

\subsection{System Context}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SystemContext.png}
  \caption{System Context}
  \label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{figure}

The system context for this project consists of a user(s), an expense tracking system, 
a budgeting analysis generator, and several databases. The user provides expense 
tracking inputs, such as physical/digital receipts or manual expense entries, and 
receives financial assessments. The expense tracking system processes user inputs, 
generates budgetary evaluations, and interacts with the financial analysis program 
and databases. The expense tracking system is also responsible for ensuring the 
validity of all inputs and provides a response if an invalid input is identified. 
The budgeting analysis generator provides expense categorization and evaluation 
functionalities, such as data analysis and visualization, and supports the expense 
tracking system in generating outputs. The database will be used to store user 
account information, user budget data, and supports the expense tracking system 
in storing and retrieving specific items and their respective categories. 
The system will typically be used for personal finance management, budgeting, 
and expense tracking, and may also be used for educational purposes. While 
the system is not safety-critical, it is important to ensure that the system is 
reliable and accurate in its calculations and analysis to provide users with 
trustworthy insights into their financial situation.

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The users of the \textit{Plutos} budgeting application can be grouped into four main categories based on their financial experience and needs. These groups represent varying levels of financial literacy and desired interaction with budgeting tools.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{First and Second-Year Undergraduate Students [Primary]} \\ 
		This group consists of young adults who are new to managing their finances independently, such as those living away from home for the first time. The characteristics of these users are as follows:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Financial Knowledge:} Limited experience with budgeting, managing expenses like rent and groceries. Usually have limited financial independence.
			\item \textbf{Time Management:} Busy schedules juggling school, work, and social commitments. Likely to prefer simple, intuitive interfaces that reduce time spent on budgeting.
			\item \textbf{Pain Points:} Lack of education on budgeting, potential to overspend due to unfamiliarity with managing day-to-day expenses.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Upper-Year Undergraduate and Post-Graduate Students [Secondary]}
		This group includes more experienced students who have more financial independence as they have had experience managing their finances (in previous years living independently).  They have a better understanding of budgeting and have developed more mature spending habits.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Financial Knowledge:}  Some experience balancing school and work, likely to have a clearer understanding of budgeting needs and differentiating between wants and needs.
			\item \textbf{Time Management:} Likely to have more experience managing limited time and money, though they may still struggle with large financial decisions such as housing or loans.
			\item \textbf{Pain Points:}  May underestimate or overestimate budget needs, particularly with larger expenses.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Early Career Professionals [Tertiary]}
		New graduates or individuals recently introduced to the workforce fall into this category. They likely have more stable incomes and financial independence.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Financial Knowledge:} More knowledgeable about saving, budgeting, and managing recurring expenses but still learning to navigate significant financial decisions.
			\item \textbf{Time Management:} May experience stress due to work-related issues and life changes such as moving to a new city and budgeting/tracking expenses may be another stress inducer on top of the new environment.
			\item \textbf{Pain Points:} Struggles with planning for long-term financial goals or managing joint accounts with a partner.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Retirees [Tertiary]}
		Although retirees are not a primary focus, they may use the application to simplify financial tracking and planning for a fixed income.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Financial Knowledge:} Likely to have extensive experience with financial management but may struggle to adapt to modern budgeting tools.
			\item \textbf{Time Management:} Older users may face physical limitations (e.g., difficulty typing or navigating) and slower adaptation to new technologies.
			\item \textbf{Pain Points:} Difficulty managing finances without a steady income and adapting to increased living expenses.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\subsection{System Constraints}


\begin{enumerate}[label=C\arabic*]
  \item The system must be developed as a mobile application using a
  cross-platform framework (e.g., React Native, Flutter) to ensure
  compatibility with both iOS and Android devices.
  \item The system must utilize a cloud-based backend technology (e.g., AWS,
  Firebase) to provide scalability, reliability, and compatibility across
  environments.
  \item The system must integrate with a third-party OCR library (e.g.,
  Tesseract OCR, Google Vision API) to provide OCR functionality. This is a
  constraint because it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel and build an OCR
  system from scratch.
  \item The system must implement secure password storage and authentication
  mechanisms using a trusted third-party authentication service (e.g., Auth0,
  Firebase). This is to ensure secure user data handling and privacy.
  \item The project must implement a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using
  GitHub Actions that automatically runs tests, checks code quality, and
  verifies builds with every commit. This is to ensure that the code is always
  in a deployable state.
  \item The system shall use a dependency management tool (e.g., npm for
  JavaScript, pip for Python) to track external libraries. This is to ensure
  organized dependency management across different working environments.

\noindent\textbf{Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User-Centered Design}: The scope focuses on features that
    users expect from a smart budgeting app, aligning with current market
    demands for personal finance tools that offer automation (e.g., receipt
    scanning) and financial insights. 
    \item \textbf{Technical Feasibility}: Developing an ML model for parsing and
    categorizing receipts makes the project a feasible challenge for the team,
    without making it overly complicated.
    \item \textbf{Time and Resource Constraints}: By narrowing the scope to core
    personal finance features, the team ensures that the project can be
    completed within the specified timeline and budget.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Modeling Decisions}
The application's architecture follows a modular, service-oriented design, with key components (i.e., receipt scanning, expense categorization, and budgeting reports) being developed as independent, reusable modules.\\

\noindent\textbf{Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: A modular approach allows the application to scale more easily by isolating functionalities into distinct services (e.g., a dedicated service for expense categorization). This reduces interdependencies and facilitates future growth.
    \item \textbf{Maintainability}: Modular components are easier to update and test, as changes to one service do not necessarily impact others. This also allows the application to accommodate feature updates and bug fixes more efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Reusability}: By designing reusable components (e.g., UI elements, API services), the application can easily extend its capabilities or integrate with other systems in the future.
    \item \textbf{Use of JSON}: JSON is lightweight, human-readable, and widely used for web and mobile applications. Its simplicity makes it ideal for transmitting structured data between the client and server, ensuring smooth communication with minimal overhead.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
Several assumptions were made during the development and design process. These assumptions include the expectation that users will regularly scan receipts, that mobile users are the primary audience, and that financial data privacy is of utmost importance.\\

\noindent\textbf{Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Receipt Scanning}: The assumption that users will consistently
    scan receipts underpins the application's core functionality. This assumption is
    based on trends observed in personal finance apps where automation is a key
    value proposition for users.
    \item \textbf{Mobile-First Audience}: It is assumed that the majority of
    users will access the application via mobile devices. This assumption is
    driven by the current dominance of mobile platforms for personal finance
    management, offering convenience and accessibility.
    \item \textbf{Privacy and Security}: The assumption that users expect high
    standards of data privacy and security informs the application's adherence to
    data protection regulations. Users handling sensitive financial data expect
    robust protection mechanisms.
    \item \textbf{Stable Internet Connection}: It is assumed that users will
    have access to a stable internet connection while using the app, especially
    for features that require cloud processing (e.g., receipt scanning, data
    syncing, and report generation).
    \item \textbf{Regular Application Usage}: The assumption is that users will
    interact with the application on a regular basis (e.g., weekly or monthly),
    allowing the application to collect sufficient user data and provide
    up-to-date financial insights and budgeting trends.
    \item \textbf{User Financial Literacy}: The application assumes a basic
    level of financial literacy among its users, meaning that they will be able
    to understand concepts like budgets, expenses, savings, and categories
    without extensive in-application education.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Typical Values}
For certain features, typical values have been used to inform design and development, such as default budget categories, receipt parsing accuracy thresholds, and system performance benchmarks.\\

\noindent\textbf{Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Default Categories}: Common budgeting categories (e.g.,
    groceries, utilities, transportation) are provided as default to simplify
    user onboarding and offer a familiar framework. These categories were
    selected based on industry standards and user behavior in similar apps. This
    is also to simplify the ML model training process.
    \item \textbf{Parsing Accuracy}: An accuracy threshold of 90\% for receipt
    parsing was established as the minimum acceptable standard, based on
    expected ML capabilities. This value ensures that the system can reliably
    extract key information from receipts without significant manual
    intervention.
    \item \textbf{Performance Benchmarks}: Typical values for system
    performance, such as load times of under two seconds for key operations
    (e.g., viewing reports), are set based on user experience research, ensuring
    that the application feels responsive and efficient.
    \item \textbf{Maximum Receipt Upload Size}: A limit of 5 MB per receipt
    ensures a balance between allowing high-resolution images for accurate OCR
    processing while keeping server storage and bandwidth requirements
    manageable. 
    \item \textbf{User Transaction History Retention}: Storing up to 3 years of
    transaction history provides users with enough data to analyze long-term
    financial trends while limiting the storage requirements for each user.
    Older transactions could be archived or made available on demand.
    \item \textbf{Frequency of Budget Update Notifications}: Weekly budget
    update notifications help users stay on top of their spending without
    overwhelming them with too many alerts. Users are reminded to review their
    financial status regularly while avoiding notification fatigue.
\end{itemize}

\section{Likely Changes}    

\begin{enumerate}[label=LC\arabic*]
	\item\textbf{Addition of New Features:} Based on user feedback, it is likely
	that new features (e.g., budgeting goal tracking, automatic expense
	categorization, or financial analytics) will be added to enhance user
	experience.
	\item\textbf{User Interface Redesign:} As usability testing is conducted, it's
	likely that the UI will undergo several iterations to improve the overall user
	experience and incorporate user feedback.
	\item \textbf{Integration with New APIs:} The application may need to
	integrate with new financial data APIs (e.g., bank transaction retrieval
	services) to enhance functionality, requiring changes to the codebase.
	\item \textbf{Change in Tech Stack:} If the team encounters difficulties with
	the current technology stack, such as performance or compatibility issues, a
	transition to new technologies (e.g., switching from React to Vue.js) is
	likely.
	\item \textbf{Performance Optimizations:} As the application scales, there may
	be a need for performance enhancements, such as optimizing database queries or
	implementing caching strategies.
	\item\textbf{Data Privacy Compliance Updates:} Changes in legal requirements
	may require updates to the application's data handling and privacy policies to
	ensure compliance.
	\item\textbf{Updates to User Authentication Method:} There may be a transition
	to a more secure authentication method (e.g., implementing two-factor
	authentication) based on user feedback and security best practices.
	\item\textbf{Feedback Mechanism for Users:} Adding a feedback mechanism within
	the application (e.g., surveys or feedback forms) to gather user insights and
	suggestions for improvements is likely, ensuring continuous enhancement of the
	application based on user needs.
  \item \textbf{Change in Database Choice:} During the development phase, the
	initial database choice may need to change due to performance issues or
	scalability requirements (e.g., moving from SQLite to PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\section{Unlikely Changes}    

\begin{enumerate}[label=ULC\arabic*]
	\item \textbf{Complete Rewrite of the Application:} A complete rewrite of the
	application's codebase is unlikely unless there are significant fundamental
	flaws that cannot be addressed through refactoring.
	\item \textbf{Switching Platforms:} Transitioning from a mobile-first approach
	to a purely desktop application is unlikely if the initial target audience is
	primarily mobile users.
	\item \textbf{Adopting a New Programming Language:} Changing the programming
	language for the entire project (e.g., from JavaScript to Ruby) midway through
	development is unlikely due to the complexity and resource investment
	required.
	\item \textbf{Elimination of Existing Features:} Removing core features that
	are central to the application's purpose (e.g., expense tracking) is unlikely,
	as these are fundamental to user expectations and functionality.
	\item \textbf{Change in Target Audience:} A shift in the target audience
	(e.g., from personal budgeting to corporate finance management) is unlikely as
	it would require a fundamental reevaluation of the application's design,
	features, and use cases.
	\item \textbf{Discontinuation of Data Storage:} Completely removing any form
	of data storage (e.g., opting for a stateless application) is unlikely, as the
	core functionality relies on data retention for budgeting purposes.
	\item \textbf{Pivot to a Social Networking Feature Set:} A major pivot to add
	social networking features (e.g., allowing users to connect with friends or
	share budgets) is unlikely, as it diverges from the core functionality of
	personal budgeting and may complicate the application's primary purpose.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.
